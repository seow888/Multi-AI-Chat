This provides a fair and accurate record of the main contents and condition of the\ncontents of the property, and the property\u2019s internal condition. You are reminded that it is your responsibility at the beginning of the tenancy\nto note any specific discrepancies on the inventory that you do not agree with i.e. marks on walls, carpets, etc. If no such additional notes\nare made by the tenant within 7days of receipt of the report, the inventory will be deemed as accepted as read. Unless otherwise stated, it\nis accepted that any listed item is in good condition and free from any obvious defect, if the condition column is left empty this is due to\nthere being no notable damage/cleanliness issue to note. A significant defect is normally seen as damage, usage or soiled which may\nconstitute a discrepancy assessment upon termination of the tenancy. A list of abbreviations is provided for your guidance.\nWE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS LISTED IN A TENANCY AGREEMENT MAY OVERRULE THE OPINION\nOF THE ASSESSOR.\nAll electrical items are considered to be complete with plugs, bulbs and flexes etc unless specified otherwise. This is no guarantee of, or\nreport on, the adequacy of, or safety of, any such equipment.\nEND OF TENANCY INFORMATION\nPlease read all these notes fully as they state what needs to happen for a smooth check out process as well as what our clerks are trained\nto look for and note within a property.

We will be inspecting all\nfurnishings and appliances. You are required to return the property the same way as noted in the original inventory report; most managing\nagents and landlords will have to instruct professional cleaners if this is not done, this cost can be deducted from your deposit.\nFLOORING: Needs to be fully cleaned.

The condition of the property at the start of the tenancy, as\ndescribed in the inventory will be compared to the condition of the property at the end of the tenancy. Details of any alterations to the\nproperty after the inventory has been agreed upon should be noted on a separate addendum sheet and agreed by the tenant and the\nmanaging agent/landlord. At the end of the tenancy a `Check Out report will be conducted to determine any changes to the inventory. The\nTenant should gain permission from the managing agent/landlord if they wish to remove or store any items during the tenancy and this\nshould be confirmed in writing by the managing agent/landlord. The inventory clerk cannot undertake to move heavy items of furniture or to\nmake searches in inaccessible locations such as loft spaces, cellars, locked rooms and high level cupboards, or to unpack items. We\nreserve the right not to handle or move items deemed to be fragile or valuable. In addition the inventory clerk reserves the right not to\nhandle items that may be of a health hazard and to generalise/summarise on such items deemed to be unsuitable for further inspection.\nDisclaimer\nThis Inventory Report has been prepared by an inventory clerk who is not an expert in buildings, furnishings, decoration, woods, antiques\nor a qualified surveyor. This check out relates only to the furniture and all the landlord's equipment and contents in the property. It is no\nguarantee or report on the adequacy of, or safety of any such equipment or contents, merely a record that such items exist in the property\nat the date of preparing the inventory and the superficial condition of same. City Clerks will not take water meter readings unless the meter\nis clearly visible within the property or attached to an exterior wall at low/accessible level. Windows throughout the property have not been\ntested for function or operation. Descriptions are purely based on the superficial appearance of windows, frames and locks. City Clerks can\naccept no liability arising from any failure of the windows or parts thereof to function properly at all. The inventory clerk cannot undertake\nthe testing of appliances and is not qualified to report on the safety of any appliances other than a general visual inspection of condition. All\nelectrical items are deemed to be complete with fixings (plugs, cables etc) unless otherwise stated.\nFurniture & Furnishings (Fire) (Safety) Regulations 1988 (1993)\nThe fire and safety regulations regarding furnishing, gas, electrical and similar services are ultimately the responsibility of the instructing\nprincipal. Where the Inventory notes \"Fire Regulation Label Attached\", this should not be interpreted to mean the item\ncomplies with the \"furniture and furnishings (fire) (safety) (amendments) 1993\". It is a record that the item had a label as described or\nsimilar to that detailed in the \"guide\" published by the Department of Trade and Industry January 1997 (or subsequent date). It is not a\nstatement that the item can be considered to comply with the Regulations.\nFlat 1203, Bouchon Point, 7 Cendal Crescent, London, E1 2JA\nhttps://invba.se/r/64f108caab9ab\nPage 3 of 26\nTenant Initials: __________\n\n----Page Break----\n1.

This provides a fair and accurate record of the main contents and condition of the\ncontents of the property, and the property\u2019s internal condition. You are reminded that it is your responsibility at the beginning of the tenancy\nto note any specific discrepancies on the inventory that you do not agree with i.e. marks on walls, carpets, etc. If no such additional notes\nare made by the tenant within 7days of receipt of the report, the inventory will be deemed as accepted as read. Unless otherwise stated, it\nis accepted that any listed item is in good condition and free from any obvious defect, if the condition column is left empty this is due to\nthere being no notable damage/cleanliness issue to note. A significant defect is normally seen as damage, usage or soiled which may\nconstitute a discrepancy assessment upon termination of the tenancy. A list of abbreviations is provided for your guidance.\nWE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS LISTED IN A TENANCY AGREEMENT MAY OVERRULE THE OPINION\nOF THE ASSESSOR.\nAll electrical items are considered to be complete with plugs, bulbs and flexes etc unless specified otherwise. This is no guarantee of, or\nreport on, the adequacy of, or safety of, any such equipment.\nEND OF TENANCY INFORMATION\nPlease read all these notes fully as they state what needs to happen for a smooth check out process as well as what our clerks are trained\nto look for and note within a property.

The condition of the property at the start of the tenancy, as\ndescribed in the inventory will be compared to the condition of the property at the end of the tenancy. Details of any alterations to the\nproperty after the inventory has been agreed upon should be noted on a separate addendum sheet and agreed by the tenant and the\nmanaging agent/landlord. At the end of the tenancy a `Check Out report will be conducted to determine any changes to the inventory. The\nTenant should gain permission from the managing agent/landlord if they wish to remove or store any items during the tenancy and this\nshould be confirmed in writing by the managing agent/landlord. The inventory clerk cannot undertake to move heavy items of furniture or to\nmake searches in inaccessible locations such as loft spaces, cellars, locked rooms and high level cupboards, or to unpack items. We\nreserve the right not to handle or move items deemed to be fragile or valuable. In addition the inventory clerk reserves the right not to\nhandle items that may be of a health hazard and to generalise/summarise on such items deemed to be unsuitable for further inspection.\nDisclaimer\nThis Inventory Report has been prepared by an inventory clerk who is not an expert in buildings, furnishings, decoration, woods, antiques\nor a qualified surveyor. This check out relates only to the furniture and all the landlord's equipment and contents in the property. It is no\nguarantee or report on the adequacy of, or safety of any such equipment or contents, merely a record that such items exist in the property\nat the date of preparing the inventory and the superficial condition of same. City Clerks will not take water meter readings unless the meter\nis clearly visible within the property or attached to an exterior wall at low/accessible level. Windows throughout the property have not been\ntested for function or operation. Descriptions are purely based on the superficial appearance of windows, frames and locks. City Clerks can\naccept no liability arising from any failure of the windows or parts thereof to function properly at all. The inventory clerk cannot undertake\nthe testing of appliances and is not qualified to report on the safety of any appliances other than a general visual inspection of condition. All\nelectrical items are deemed to be complete with fixings (plugs, cables etc) unless otherwise stated.\nFurniture & Furnishings (Fire) (Safety) Regulations 1988 (1993)\nThe fire and safety regulations regarding furnishing, gas, electrical and similar services are ultimately the responsibility of the instructing\nprincipal. Where the Inventory notes \"Fire Regulation Label Attached\", this should not be interpreted to mean the item\ncomplies with the \"furniture and furnishings (fire) (safety) (amendments) 1993\". It is a record that the item had a label as described or\nsimilar to that detailed in the \"guide\" published by the Department of Trade and Industry January 1997 (or subsequent date). It is not a\nstatement that the item can be considered to comply with the Regulations.\nFlat 1203, Bouchon Point, 7 Cendal Crescent, London, E1 2JA\nhttps://invba.se/r/64f108caab9ab\nPage 3 of 26\nTenant Initials: __________\n\n----Page Break----\n1.

Here's a summary of the attached inventory report, presented in a way that's clear, organized, and hopefully OCD-friendly, just like a WhatsApp chat:\n\n*\ud83d\udcc4 *Document Overview:*\n\n*   This is a *detailed inventory and check-in report* for a rental property located at:\n    *   Flat 1203, Bouchon Point, 7 Cendal Crescent, London, E1 2JA\n    *   Prepared by *City Clerks* on September 1st, 2023.\n    *   Prepared on behalf of *Regent Property*\n    *   Inspected by *Luke J M*\n\n*\ud83d\udcdd *Purpose of the Document:*\n\n*   It's a record of the *condition and contents* of the property *at the start of a tenancy*.\n*   It aims to provide a *fair and accurate* description for both the landlord/agent and the tenant.\n*   It's used to *compare* the property's condition at the *end of the tenancy* and determine if any damage has occurred.\n\n*\u26a0\ufe0f *Key Points & Disclaimers (Important!):*\n\n*   *Acceptance:* If you (the tenant) don't report any disagreements within *7 days* of receiving this report, it's considered *accepted as read*.\n*   *Condition:* Items are assumed to be in *good condition* unless otherwise noted.\n*   *Defects:*  \"Significant defects\" are considered damages, usage, or soiling that may lead to a deposit deduction later.\n*   *Cleanliness:* The property must be returned in the *same condition* as at the start of the tenancy, including a *professional clean* if needed to remove stains on the floor or any kind of soiling.\n*   *Damages:* Tenants are responsible for damages beyond fair wear and tear (marks, stains, scratches, etc.).\n*   *Electrical:* Electrical items are complete with plugs etc. but this isn't a guarantee of safety.\n*   *Appliances:* No appliance safety checks were performed. It is a visual inspection of the condition only.\n*   *Moving Items:* The clerk does not move heavy furniture, access restricted areas, or handle fragile items.\n*   *Fire Safety:* Check fire safety regulations, not the responsibility of the clerks. Labels seen noted, no guarantee of compliance.\n\n*\ud83d\udecb\ufe0f *What's Covered in Detail:*\n\n*   *Schedule of Condition:* Overall cleanliness, decorative order, flooring, windows, etc. are noted as \"Good Condition\"\n*   *Key List:*  Lists the number of keys and FOBs for the property (1x FOB, 1 x Yale lock).

Test Result: Passed, Replace 2032\n*   *Room-by-Room Inventory:* Detailed descriptions of each room, including:\n    *   *Entrance:* Doors, fixtures, lighting, flooring.\n    *   *Bathroom:* Fixtures, tiles, bathtub, toilet, shower.\n    *   *Kitchen/Reception:*  Appliances (oven, hob, fridge, dishwasher, microwave), units, furniture (dining table, chairs, sofa).\n    *   *Balcony:* Sliding door, flooring, lighting.\n    *   *Bedroom 1:* Windows, curtains, bed, wardrobes, bedside tables.\n     *   *En Suite:* Fixtures, tiles, shower, toilet\n    *   *Bedroom 2:* Windows, curtains, bed, wardrobe, bedside tables.\n\n*\ud83d\ude4b *Additional Info:*\n\n*   No pets or smoking evidence or odours were noted.\n*   Tenant forwarding address, tenancy length, removal of rubbish are marked as \"N/A\".\n\n*\u270d\ufe0f *Declaration:*\n\n*   The document includes a declaration stating that if no written comments are made within 7 days, the inventory is accepted.\n*   The document was *signed* by:\n    *   *Clerk:* LUKE J M\n    *   *Tenants:* WENJING DING and MINJIA ZHU\n\n*\ud83e\uddd0 *So, Is It Spam?*\n\n*   *Likely Not:* Given that it's a detailed inventory report, it's unlikely to be spam. It contains specific information about a property and tenants names.\n*  *Impact:* *If you are WENJING DING or MINJIA ZHU, this document directly impacts you*\n\n*\ud83d\udea8 *Action You May Need to Take*\n\n*  If you ARE WENJING DING or MINJIA ZHU:*\n    *  *Review:* *Thoroughly review the report*, compare with the actual state of the property, and note discrepancies you may have.\n    *   *Contact:*  If you disagree with any item or spot something wrong *contact the managing agent* or the *inventory clerk* within the specified 7-day timeframe.\n    *   *Keep it Safe:* Store the document somewhere safe and you can easily access, as it will be needed upon moving out from the property.\n*   *If you ARE NOT WENJING DING or MINJIA ZHU:*\n    *  *Ignore:* If you do not have connection with any of the names and address mentioned, and you haven't moved into a new property, then you can ignore this email/message.\n\nI hope that's helpful and not too overwhelming! Let me know if you have any more questions.\n"
